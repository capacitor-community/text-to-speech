# Contributing

This guide provides instructions for contributing to this Capacitor plugin.

## Developing

### Local Setup

1. Fork and clone the repo.
1. Install the dependencies.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1. Install SwiftLint if you're on macOS.

    ```shell
    brew install swiftlint
    ```

### Scripts

#### `npm run build`

Build the plugin web assets and generate plugin API documentation using [`@capacitor/docgen`](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor-docgen).

It will compile the TypeScript code from `src/` into ESM JavaScript in `dist/esm/`. These files are used in apps with bundlers when your plugin is imported.

Then, Rollup will bundle the code into a single file at `dist/plugin.js`. This file is used in apps without bundlers by including it as a script in `index.html`.

#### `npm run verify`

Build and validate the web and native projects.

This is useful to run in CI to verify that the plugin builds for all platforms.

#### `npm run lint` / `npm run fmt`

Check formatting and code quality, autoformat/autofix if possible.

This template is integrated with ESLint, Prettier, and SwiftLint. Using these tools is completely optional, but the [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community/) strives to have consistent code style and structure for easier cooperation.

## Versioning

Don't change the plugin version manually, the version change is automated with `standard-version` package.

## Publishing

First run:

```shell
npm run release
```

That will update the plugin version and update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with latest changes. Then it will ask you to run:

```shell
git push --follow-tags origin master && npm publish
```

That creates a tag on gitbhub and publishes the package on npm.

Go to the [github tags section](https://github.com/capacitor-community/text-to-speech/tags), pick the latest tag and create a release for it.

> **Note**: The [`files`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#files) array in `package.json` specifies which files get published. If you rename files/directories or add files elsewhere, you may need to update it.
